Huiyi Nong Relefection
The differences in interpretation at all stages of the assignment:
My sketch for lost and found was Shawki's airpods that he lost during orentation day, and it's sad that he even sold his old phone to get this new pair of airpod gen2. However I was trying to recreate the shape of this right ear airpod. At first I was building the shape the bar of the airpod with a light grey sliver color in a rectangle shape. And later I was trying to create the in ear part that originally I want to make it slightly rotate and off. But I was having some trouble about finding the locations in the editor.    
Shawki description:
Lost item
Lab prompt
Right ear 'AirPod pro'
Lost my right AirPod pro Gen 2 during orientation week. : (I sold my old iPhone to buy a new pair from Best Buy and then I lost the AirPods.
My interpretation of the image:
I am thinking of just one side of the earbud with slightly white and grey colors. And the elipse shape of the head part, also making a rectangle for the holder? part.
