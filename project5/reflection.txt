We were in a group chat and we posted our pics in there. And kaori helped us get the groups together. So I got kaori's head, my own body, and aisha's lower. 

so i first creaet the head with two ellipse shape one with yellow and another white on the top to make this moon head. and I just wanted to be simple added the facial expression with curve and number3.
And then i created the body part with rectangle as the shirt and a small one for the neck. For arms I made the left first with ellipses and rectangle in pink and for the right arm I just use to x,y location to mirrored over.
