  <h1>Project 5: optical illusion</h1>
  <p>This project is to esign and code an animating optical illusion and consider its deployment. For my inspo I add the picture i found online, and i was trying to create the pattern like my sample picture. And I also take look at the marcel duchamp rotoreliefs series and i want to make something with that pattern and i want to have motion like spinning and 'changing' color. </p>
