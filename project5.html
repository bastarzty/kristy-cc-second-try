  <h1>Optical Illusion</h1>
  <p>This project is to esign and code an animating optical illusion and consider its deployment. For my inspo I add the picture i found online, and i was trying to create the pattern like my sample picture. <br>
    And I also take look at the marcel duchamp rotoreliefs series and i want to make something with that pattern and i want to have motion like spinning and 'changing' color.

    <br>Building on the inspiration from the picture I found online, I set out to recreate a pattern that captures its essence but also integrates my own spin—both literally and figuratively. <br>I explored Marcel Duchamp’s Rotoreliefs series to further develop my approach, fascinated by how Duchamp used simple circular forms and motion to create visual effects that feel hypnotic and multidimensional. <br>I wanted to evoke that sense of immersion and movement in my work by adding an element of motion, specifically spinning, combined with color transitions that change dynamically.
    
    <br> <br>To achieve this, I focused on setting up a rotating structure using rotate() and frameCount in p5.js, allowing the elements to spin smoothly and continuously.<br> The trick was to find the right balance between rotation speed and visual stability, ensuring that the motion remained engaging without overwhelming the pattern itself. Additionally, I experimented with color transitions that could create a feeling of continuous change. <br> Using functions like lerpColor() and sin() to control hues allowed me to generate color shifts that respond to the spinning motion, adding a layer of depth and complexity.
    
    <br> <br>Throughout the coding process, I played with different values and tried various design tweaks to make the animation feel fluid and harmonious. The interplay of spinning and color-shifting ended up creating an almost meditative effect, reminiscent of Duchamp’s work but with a unique twist that feels contemporary and digital. <br> This experience taught me about the subtleties of combining motion and color, as well as the importance of balancing inspiration from historical artworks with my creative perspective in the digital medium.</p>
