    <br>
    <p>
      I am from a design background and I'm interested in editorials, graphics, images, and interaction design that helps people.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      As a designer and creator, I am passionate about crafting experiences that bridge the gap between technology and human interaction. My work explores themes of inclusivity, play, and introspection, with a particular focus 
      on designing tools and experiences for individuals with ADHD.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drawing from personal insights and a deep interest in experiential design, I aim to create<br>
      projects that not only engage but also empower, fostering creativity, focus, and connection.<br>
      From interactive games to thoughtful interfaces, my goal is to reimagine technology as an<br>
      empathetic and intuitive extension of the human experience.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      I seek a transformation in my career that goes beyond simply branding and building visuals. I also want to embrace user experiences in my work.
