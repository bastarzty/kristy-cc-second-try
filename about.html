  <p>I transfer my design thinking into design reality. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Parsons Design&Techology</li>
    <li> I am from a design background and I'm intersted in editorials, graphics, images and also intereaction design that helps people. As a designer and creator, I am passionate about crafting experiences that bridge the gap between technology and human interaction. My work explores themes of inclusivity, play, and introspection, with a particular focus on designing tools and experiences for individuals with ADHD. Drawing from personal insights and a deep interest in experiential design, I aim to create projects that not only engage but also empower, fostering creativity, focus, and connection. From interactive games to thoughtful interfaces, my goal is to reimagine technology as an empathetic and intuitive extension of the human experience.  </li>
    <li> I seek a transformation on my career that not than just simply branding and building visuals, and i also wanted to embrace user experiences into my works. </li>
