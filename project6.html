  <h1>Project 6: Data Portrait</h1>
  <p>This project we create a data portrait out of a personal habit of myself. The concept for this project originated from the need to creatively visualize my screen time data over a week. I wanted to explore a dynamic and engaging way to present the data while highlighting the uniqueness of each day. Inspired by the free-floating nature of bubbles, the idea was to represent each day's screen time as a bubble, with its size proportional to the time spent and its color signifying the day. </p>
