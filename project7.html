  <h1>Project 7: Autobiographical Game</h1>
  <p>This project is to design and code a game that tells an aspect of my own story. Story design
    First time designing and making a game in my life! 
    My first step was just ask myself what should I tell people to, what kind of story thats related to myself? So I started thinking about my past and my journey to today. In my point of view I sort of thinking the quarantine changed a lot in my life. So I decided to tell something about this about also things about I havent move to the states. </p>
