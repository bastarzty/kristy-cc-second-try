  <h1> Lost and found<br> This project aims to create the graphic of something that our classmate lost. Let's find Shawki's earbud here!</h1>

The differences in interpretation at all stages of the assignment:
My sketch for lost and found was Shawkis airpods that he lost during orentation day, and its sad that he even sold his old phone to get this new pair of airpod gen2. However I was trying to recreate the shape of this right ear airpod. 
<br>At first I was building the shape the bar of the airpod with a light grey sliver color in a rectangle shape. And later I was trying to create the in ear part that originally I want to make it slightly rotate and off. But I was having some trouble about finding the locations in the editor.  <br>  
Shawki description:<br>
Lost item
Lab prompt
Right ear AirPod pro
Lost my right AirPod pro Gen 2 during orientation week. : I sold my old iPhone to buy a new pair from Best Buy and then I lost the AirPods.
My interpretation of the image:
I am thinking of just one side of the earbud with slightly white and grey colors. 
<br>And the elipse shape of the head part, also making a rectangle for the holder? part.</p>
